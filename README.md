VPNs can securely link two computers (or networks) together across an insecure network such as the internet, allowing them to send encapsulated and encrypted data to each other.
* One of the most common use cases for VPNs in the workplace is to facilitate the secure access to online work resources from your home. For example, a remote worker using a foreign Japanese internet provider is risking an information link if they attempt to access files from a server based in America without use of a VPN that could properly encrypt that internet traffic.

VPNs can also substitute your IP address with one of the VPN's servers, causing service providers to believe that your device (and by extension, you) are located in a different part of the world. 
* The main use for this application of VPNs include protecting the privacy and anonymity of users connecting to service providers they don't want having access to their sensitive data.
* In addition, VPN users can also use IP changing to view online content that is region-locked by certian service providers such as Netflix, HOBOmax, and others.
